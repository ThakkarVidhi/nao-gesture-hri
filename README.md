## Demo and Preview

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of NAOgest in action:

- ðŸ¤– NAO executes "greeting" and "pointing" gestures in Webots.
- ðŸ”„ Scenario scripts define gesture sequences with delays and transitions.
- ðŸŽ¬ Real-time animation synchronized with Webots simulation clock.
- ðŸŽ¥ Demo Video

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThakkarVidhi/nao-gesture-hri.git
   cd nao-gesture-hri
   ```

2. Open Webots and load the provided project world file:
   - `worlds/nao-gesture-hri.wbt`

3. Run the simulation and observe the NAO robot executing gestures.

4. Ensure C controller is selected and configured in the Webots world.

---

## Usage

- Place gesture motions in `motions/` directory as `.motion` files.
- Use the provided Webots controller to run the scenario aftercompiling:
   ```bash
   controllers/nao_controller/nao_controller.c
   ```

- To test a specific gesture manually, invoke:
   ```c
   start_motion(motion_name)
   ```

---

## Configuration

Configuration is managed in `nao-gesture-hri.wbproj`.

---

## Testing

This project includes basic manual testing. To test the application:

- Launch the Webots simulator and load the ```nao-gesture-hri``` world file.

- Start the simulation and observe the NAO robotâ€™s gesture-based actions in response to coded triggers.

- Manually test each scenario to verify that gestures are performed accurately and consistently.

- Monitor the simulation logs and console output for any unexpected behavior or execution errors.

## FAQs

**Q: What should I do if Webots fails to load the NAO robot correctly?**  
A: Ensure you have the latest version of Webots installed. Download the NAO model if prompted.

**Q: Can I use this project with a real NAO robot?**  
A: This is primarily designed for Webots simulation. Adapting to real hardware is possible but requires additional SDK integration.

**Q: How can I add custom gestures?**  
A: Add a new MOTION file in the `motions` directory and reference it in the controller to simulate the gesture.
